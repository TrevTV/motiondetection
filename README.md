# Motion Detection
Crappy python script that runs a thing if motion is detected.
# How To Use
Open the motionjs folder and open the index.html file in  your browser. 
Run reader.py (Your screen must be set to 1920x1080 for it to work properly or change the "top" and "left" value for screenshots)
# How To Change Commands
Open reader.py with a text editor.
Go to the last line where it says "Motion Detected" and "No Motion Detection".
Change the if statements to what you want to do.
